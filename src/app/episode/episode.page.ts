Last night the bikini model bounced into the house in a whirl of hair extensions, fake tan and excessively white teeth - the likes of which we haven’t seen since Britney’s Las Vegas residency.\\n\\nFortunately for us Kim is a flirty kind of gal, systematically going through each and every guy to decide which one will be her safest bet. It’s pretty darn easy when she has the ability to turn each of them into a blubbering pool of drool. The best Justin can come up with is ‘what’s your favourite colour?’ (Green) and ‘do you remember how oranges used to make your fingers smell?’ (Seriously what the hell?)","firstAired":"2018-05-28T10:00:00.000Z","rating":7.3,"votes":62,"runtime":55,"watched":false},{"traktSeasonNumber":1,"traktNumber":3,"absoluteNumber":null,"code":"S01E03","title":"Is Grant Dense?","imdbId":null,"tmdbId":1495378,"tvdbId":6699346,"traktId":3010115,"overview":"The girls and boys are realising that the next coupling is fast approaching, and it’s sent the islanders into a flurry of pacts and flirting, analysing every conversation with each other.

Over in the bedroom, Kim is still trying to get away from Josh. It’s like the bed is no man’s land and she feels safer down in the trenches.

Thankfully they have different coloured hair and are thus, easily identifiable.

Calling himself the ‘poetry killa’ he lets us know he feels ‘fresher than a newly washed piece of corn’ and the romance is almost too much to take.\\n\\nJosh trots outside to try some more fresh rhymes on Tayla, the current focus of his attention, after Kim made it pretty darn clear she has 0% interest in him. Tayla and Josh have a solid D&M about the length of her leg hair, after which she tells him not to hold her hand - so naturally he tries to hold her hand.
